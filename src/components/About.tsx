          I’m a student who enjoys learning by building and improving things step
          by step. I like understanding how things work rather than focusing only
          on how they look. I believe real progress comes from consistency,
          curiosity, and learning from mistakes. This portfolio represents my
          journey so far and the effort I put into growing with every project.
